This project, Teacher Management System, is a Java-based console application designed to manage teacher records and their schedules using PostgreSQL as the database and JDBC for database interaction.

 Project Overview
The system provides two primary management modules:
1. Teacher Management  
   - Add, View, Update, and Delete teacher records.
2. Schedule Management  
   - Add, View, Update, Delete, and Retrieve schedule details.

 Key Features
✅ Database Connectivity:  
   - Connects to PostgreSQL database using JDBC.  
✅ Entity Relationships:  
   - Teachers are linked to their schedules via a relational mapping.  
✅ CRUD Operations:  
   - Full support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities.  
✅ Console-Based User Interaction:  
   - Uses `Scanner` for handling user input.  
✅ Structured Navigation:  
   - Presents menu-driven options for managing data efficiently.  

 How It Works
1️⃣ The application establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database.  
2️⃣ Users select options for Teacher or Schedule management.  
3️⃣ CRUD functions interact with the database tables, updating records accordingly.  
4️⃣ The `INNER JOIN` operation in `detailsofSchedule()` fetches schedule details linked to teachers.  
5️⃣ The application loops until the user decides to exit.
